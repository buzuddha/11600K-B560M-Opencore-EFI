# 11600K-B560M-Opencore-EFI
EFI for this particular config

Config:\n
CPU: 11600K\n
GPU: AMD WX7100\n
MB: MSI B560M Mortar\n
WIFI/BT: bcm943602CDP\n
OC: 0.9.3 if I recall correctly\n

What works - everything except\n 
1) Wake from sleep via USB - you have to push the powerbutton. I've activated wake from sleep via USB in the UEFI and run into the instant wake issues. I haven't spent enough time debugging that, and the power button is easily accessible for my set up.\n
2) Universal control
